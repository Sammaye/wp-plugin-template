# My Personal WordPress Plugin Template
A personal template with shits n' giggles to get started with any WordPress job

This repo is designed to be nothing more than something I can clone down to a new project and hack away at. It contains a number of very useful functions and features, which will only grow the more projects I do.

By the time this repo matures it could be very comprehensive, enough to teach other WordPress developers.

As ever there are likely to be some bugs and mistakes in the code, but I will endeavour for there not to be.
